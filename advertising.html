					<h2 class="major">The Past, Present, and Future</h2>
					<p>With a commercial future headed towards space, there is no doubt that there will be a debate on how advertisements will be handled. Historically there have been various groups that have attempted to launch space advertisements such as the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-08-04-mn-20350-story.html" target="_blank">infamous 1996 attempt to launch a billboard into space to promote the summer Olympic games.</a> While that attempt may not have come to fruition the rapid development of privatized space travel may see a world revisiting this past. Advertising is a staple of capitalist societies where advertisements can be seen in all types of forms and locations. While either in the real world in a physical form or the online world in a digital form, advertisements are often despised by the end user, but remain a necessary evil. There are two sides to this debate where there are those who support space advertising and those who are in favor and those who oppose.			</div>

					<h2 class="major">The Debate </h2>
					<p>
Traditionally there are no set laws regarding space advertisements as it remains a sort of gray area. Internationally, it is recognized that outer space is a free domain with no true means of ownership. As a result, usage of space is not prohibited in a sense allowing for a theoretical advertisement to be launched. There have been some attempts that are not full on permanent billboards, but <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/space-billboards-are-just-the-latest-orbital-stunt/" target="_blank">researchers have called even these minor instances an act of “vandalism”.</a> There is something to be said concerning the preservation of natural space in the similar concept of the national park system. While the debate is ongoing with an unpredictable future, some argue that as advertisements are a necessary evil on Earth, they will be in space as well. Funding costs for space research and exploration are often overwhelming and space advertisement is one solution. No matter how it plays out, <a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/glj98&div=51&g_sent=1&casa_token=tmQt4-2rBAUAAAAA:C8xpscJAIcvG0zI7dRwLA-OBzBuzqFqSrKNA_ZN6CQhizeN-X6MCbbxCA2zcBi45BoC6p5CPIw" target="_blank">experts advise a discussion on this issue right now rather than when it’s too late.</a>
