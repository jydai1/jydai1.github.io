					<h1 class="major">Space Tourism</h1>
					<p>Is space tourism actually beneficial? Tourism is usually seen as a benefit because it brings money into less fortunate areas. This is why, for example, the Caribbean spends so much money on tourism, because it is the backbone of the economy. However, no one lives in space, so those same benefits do not apply to space tourism. However, the industry will generate income for the countries that support it, and it will also further space exploration.</p>

					<h2 class="major">Beginnings of Space Tourism</h2>
					<p>Space tourism has been considered since the middle of the twentieth century when space exploration really started to take off. In 1954, before the first satellite was even launched to space, Thomas Cook created the “Moon Register”, which allows people to sign up for a commercial trip to the moon (Chang). Although none of the registrants ever got their trip to the moon, this was the first notion of space tourism in history. The first actual occurrence was not until 200, when the commercial space tourist Dennis Tito went to the International Space Station for an eight day stay (Chang).				</div>

					<p>Currently, the space tourism industry is growing ever so slightly, but no real progress has been made towards consistently sending tourists to space.  There are multiple companies that are working in the field. For example, Virgin Galactic is a company focused solely on space tourism. However, the company has had many setbacks and broken promises when it comes to building their business. For example, they crashed one of their shuttles in a test flight, killing multiple people (Fuller). Further, back in 2011, the company began selling tickets to space for $200,000; however, all of the people who bought those tickets have still never gone up (Davenport). Thus, Virgin Galactic, which has been at the forefront of the space tourism industry, has shed negative light on the entire scene. Perhaps if they finally successfully send their first customer to space, we will begin to see a boom in the industry. Or, another scenario is that another corporation becomes the industry leader.

					<p>However, if space tourism eventually becomes technologically feasible, it will give financial incentive for private companies to pursue space exploration. As of now, most of the investment into space is through governments and a few private companies. However, with the further commercialization of space flight, we will begin to see much more competition, and, as a result, the following benefits
				
				<ul>
				<li>Innovation in flight technology leading to cheaper flights both in and out of the atmosphere</li>
				<li><a href="dearmoon.earth" target="_blank">New artistic possibilities</a></li>
				<li>The growth of a new sector in the economy, and data on how consumers respond to new technology (Crouch)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Hence, space tourism will provide an overall benefit to humanity, but we must first build a functioning industry.</p>
