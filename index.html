					<h2 class="major">1. Mining</h2>
					<p>If the human race is to occupy, explore, or even harvest the stars, then water is necessary to not only sustain life, but to be used as a fuel source. While it can be sent into space from Earth, that process is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04749" target="_blank">extremely cost-inefficient and releases a large amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</a> Instead, we look to asteroids and other celestial bodies as a source of water. The next priority for mining in space is harvesting rare earth metals like platinum. As with water, extracting these rare Earth metals from space would be beneficial for the environment. Here on Earth, we have to take wide swaths of land and dig deep into the earth, spewing out greenhouse gases and destroying countless habitats. Not only that, platinum is also used in many green technologies, like fuel cells or catalyzers. </p>

					<p>Space mining would not only be beneficial to the environment, it would also build an economic <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/let-s-mine-asteroids-for-science-and-profit-1.10733" target="_blank">interest in the study and exploration of space.</a> According to Shane D Ross, a professor at CalTech, the sale of raw materials extracted from asteroids could bring in millions of dollars with the current technology. This number could increase with the development of new, more efficient processes. With this incentive, it is likely that mining companies will shift their focus to the stars, and pour resources into the study of space, in order to increase the magnitude of their profit margin. So the advancement of extraterrestrial sciences appears in tandem with the elevation of resource mining in space. </p>

					<h2 class="major">How</h2>
					<p>While the mining processes are still under development, two main branches of thought have appeared. One is the traditional, physical digging and mining to extract resources. However, this would only work on planetary bodies and very large bodies because on smaller asteroids, which are more common, they are delicately held together by their own gravity. The other, more flexible method would be to use the <a href="https://www.space.com/moon-asteroid-space-mining-with-concentrated-sunlight.html" target="_blank">sun’s energy either directly or indirectly to extract materials.</a> This could happen in two ways, we can use solar powered drones to melt minerals within the ground and collect the liquid. Another method is thermal mining using heliostats, or mirrors that track the sun’s position to direct solar energy into the target to fracture and expose valuable materials. </p>

					<h2 class="major">2. Colonization</h2>
					<p>Throughout the modern age, humans have been increasingly exhausting resources as the world has shifted towards consumerism. Though we are currently researching new technologies to mitigate the widespread effects of overexploitation, there will come a point where humanity will find it vital to reduce our environmental footprint by expanding past our planet: to branch out and to colonize other celestial bodies. </div>

					<h2 class="major">One Small Step: The Moon</h2>
										<p>Being in the proximity of Earth, the Moon is an ideal testing ground that scientists and enthusiasts look forward to. While void of many useful resources, the Moon serves as the first experience of a long-term deep space mission. Established in 2017, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/what-is-artemis/" target="_blank">Artemis program</a> hopes to revitalize the journey to the Moon and to expand on our current American economic power. Moreover, NASA and its partners aim to establish a long-term presence at the Moon through the implementation of a <a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-plans-artemis-moon-base-beyond-2024.html" target="_blank">“base camp”</a>, a step towards a sustainable lunar colony. The Artemis program also serves to kickstart the plan of colonizing Mars, serving as the initial testing ground for the fundamental technologies required for basic colonization. </p>

					<h2 class="major">One Giant Leap: Mars</h2>
					<p>The hot topic of space colonization, Mars has captured the interest of thousands of astronomers. From the numerous rovers exploring the Martian surface to the multitude of proposed models by space organizations such as NASA or SpaceX, it is undeniable that we will eventually be able to travel to Mars to establish our beginnings as a multiplanetary species. However, we have to consider unique factors while developing such a new colony, including the environmental, legal, and ethical concerns highlighted in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/gch2.201800062" target="_blank">this article.</a> Despite all of these new challenges, it is increasingly vital that we continue to press on in order for the progression of humanity and maintain our innovative and ambitious nature. </p>

					<h2 class="major">The Outer Solar System and Beyond</h2>
					<p>Far into the future, we may conceivably be able to colonize outside of the Solar System’s terrestrial planets. Though impracticable with our current technologies, many alternatives propose colonizing past the asteroid belt, such as Titan or the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24536505" target=_blank">Galilean moons</a> of Jupiter. Provided that we obtain more technologies to better adapt to different climates and to extract resources, it is possible to colonize these locations, where we can better understand the properties of gaseous planets and expand further than ever before. Perhaps, it may be even feasible for interstellar travel and the colonization of other planetary systems: there is already a wide amount of speculation and research being done in astrobiology to find habitable exoplanets <a href="https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/research/astrobiology-at-nasa/astrobiology-strategy/" target="_blank">(e.g.)</a>, establishing the basic knowledge required to understand our potential destinations. We may not personally be there to experience it, but what we will see will be the beginning of an eon-long journey of space exploration.</p>

					<h2 class="major">3. Tourism</h2>
					<p>Space tourism has been considered since the middle of the twentieth century when space exploration really started to take off. In 1954, before the first satellite was even launched to space, Thomas Cook created the “Moon Register”, which allows people to sign up for a commercial trip to the moon (Chang). Although none of the registrants ever got their trip to the moon, this was the first notion of space tourism in history. The first actual occurrence was not until 200, when the commercial space tourist Dennis Tito went to the International Space Station for an eight day stay (Chang).				</div>

					<h2 class="major">&nbsp</h2>
					<p>Currently, the space tourism industry is growing ever so slightly, but no real progress has been made towards consistently sending tourists to space.  There are multiple companies that are working in the field. For example, Virgin Galactic is a company focused solely on space tourism. However, the company has had many setbacks and broken promises when it comes to building their business. For example, they crashed one of their shuttles in a test flight, killing multiple people (Fuller). Further, back in 2011, the company began selling tickets to space for $200,000; however, all of the people who bought those tickets have still never gone up (Davenport). Thus, Virgin Galactic, which has been at the forefront of the space tourism industry, has shed negative light on the entire scene. Perhaps if they finally successfully send their first customer to space, we will begin to see a boom in the industry. Or, another scenario is that another corporation becomes the industry leader.

					<h2 class="major">4. Advertising</h2>
					<p>With a commercial future headed towards space, there is no doubt that there will be a debate on how advertisements will be handled. Historically there have been various groups that have attempted to launch space advertisements such as the infamous 1996 attempt to launch a billboard into space to promote the summer Olympic games. While that attempt may not have come to fruition the rapid development of privatized space travel may see a world revisiting this past. Advertising is a staple of capitalist societies where advertisements can be seen in all types of forms and locations. While either in the real world in a physical form or the online world in a digital form, advertisements are often despised by the end user, but remain a necessary evil. There are two sides to this debate where there are those who support space advertising and those who are in favor and those who oppose.			</div>

					<h2 class="major">The Debate </h2>
					<p>
Traditionally there are no set laws regarding space advertisements as it remains a sort of gray area. Internationally, it is recognized that outer space is a free domain with no true means of ownership. As a result, usage of space is not prohibited in a sense allowing for a theoretical advertisement to be launched. There have been some attempts that are not full on permanent billboards, but <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/space-billboards-are-just-the-latest-orbital-stunt/" target="_blank">researchers have called even these minor instances an act of “vandalism”.</a> There is something to be said concerning the preservation of natural space in the similar concept of the national park system. While the debate is ongoing with an unpredictable future, some argue that as advertisements are a necessary evil on Earth, they will be in space as well. Funding costs for space research and exploration are often overwhelming and space advertisement is one solution. No matter how it plays out, <a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/glj98&div=51&g_sent=1&casa_token=tmQt4-2rBAUAAAAA:C8xpscJAIcvG0zI7dRwLA-OBzBuzqFqSrKNA_ZN6CQhizeN-X6MCbbxCA2zcBi45BoC6p5CPIw" target="_blank">experts advise a discussion on this issue right now rather than when it’s too late.</a>
