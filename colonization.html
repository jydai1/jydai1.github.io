					<h1 class="major">Space Colonization</h1>
					<p>Throughout the modern age, humans have been increasingly exhausting resources as the globe has shifted towards consumerism. Though we are currently researching new technologies to mitigate the widespread effects of overexploitation, there will come a point where humanity may find it vital to reduce our environmental footprint by expanding past our planet: to branch out and to colonize other celestial bodies in hopes of a new home.

					<h2 class="major">Why Not A Challenge?</h2>
										<p>There are many arguments that argue both for and against space colonization — especially in the case of the colonization of Mars — and there are <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/02/space-is-cold-vast-and-deadly-humans-will-explore-it-anyway/" target=_blank">fundamental problems</a> hindering space exploration that are necessary to address. However, seeing as we are already looking towards surpassing these challenges for the sake of curiosity and expansion, the solution for space travel and colonization is not a far-fetched notion: broadening our sphere of influence on our universe is an inevitable future for the interests and survival of our human species.

					<h2 class="major">One Small Step: The Moon</h2>
										<p>Being in the proximity of Earth, the Moon is an ideal testing ground that scientists and enthusiasts look forward to. While void of many useful resources, the Moon serves as the first experience of a long-term deep space mission. Established in 2017, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/what-is-artemis/" target="_blank">Artemis program</a> hopes to revitalize the journey to the Moon and to expand on our current American economic power. Moreover, NASA and its partners aim to establish a long-term presence at the Moon through the implementation of a <a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-plans-artemis-moon-base-beyond-2024.html" target="_blank">“base camp”</a>, a step towards a sustainable lunar colony. The Artemis program also serves to kickstart the plan of colonizing Mars, serving as the initial testing ground for the fundamental technologies required for basic colonization. </p>

					<h2 class="major">One Giant Leap: Mars</h2>
					<p>The hot topic of space colonization, Mars has captured the interest of thousands of astronomers. From the numerous rovers exploring the Martian surface to the multitude of proposed models by space organizations such as NASA or SpaceX, it is undeniable that we will eventually be able to travel to Mars to establish our beginnings as a multiplanetary species. However, we have to consider unique factors while developing such a new colony, including the environmental, legal, and ethical concerns highlighted in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/gch2.201800062" target="_blank">this article.</a> Despite all of these new challenges, it is increasingly vital that we continue to press on in order for the progression of humanity and maintain our innovative and ambitious nature. </p>

					<h2 class="major">The Outer Solar System and Beyond</h2>
					<p>Far into the future, we may conceivably be able to colonize outside of the Solar System’s terrestrial planets. Though impracticable with our current technologies, many alternatives propose colonizing past the asteroid belt, such as Titan or the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24536505" target=_blank">Galilean moons</a> of Jupiter. Provided that we obtain more technologies to better adapt to different climates and to extract resources, it is possible to colonize these locations, where we can better understand the properties of gaseous planets and expand further than ever before. Perhaps, it may be even feasible for interstellar travel and the colonization of other planetary systems: there is already a wide amount of speculation and research being done in astrobiology to find habitable exoplanets <a href="https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/research/astrobiology-at-nasa/astrobiology-strategy/" target="_blank">(e.g.)</a>, establishing the basic knowledge required to understand our potential destinations. We may not personally be there to experience it, but what we will see will be the beginning of an eon-long journey of space exploration.</p>
