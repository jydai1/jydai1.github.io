					<ul>
					<li>Asteroids contain the water and building material that would be necessary to sustain life in space.</li>
					
					<li>Mining materials from near Earth objects puts less strain on the environment, keeping Earth habitable long enough to prepare</li>
					</ul>
<p>If the human race is to colonize, explore, or even exist in space, water is necessary to not only sustain life, but to be used as a fuel source. While it can be sent into space from Earth, that process is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04749" target="_blank">extremely cost-inefficient and releases a large amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</a> Instead we look to asteroids and other celestial bodies as a source of water as it is a less resource intensive harvesting process. In addition, some asteroids contain rare Earth metals and extracting them from space would be beneficial for the planet. Here on Earth, we destroy wide swaths of the environment, scour the earth for miles below, and spew greenhouse gases into the atmosphere searching desperately for these minerals. Not only would mining in space allow for the environment to be habitable for a longer time, but it would also be a step towards humanity’s future exodus to the stars.</p>

							<ul>
					<li>The commercialization of space mining would create an economic interest in space</li>
					
					<li><a href="https://www.nature.com/news/let-s-mine-asteroids-for-science-and-profit-1.10733" target="_blank">Companies will race to study astronomy and streamline the process of launching and retrieving spacecraft</a></li>
					</ul>			
<p>According to Shane D. Ross, a professor at CalTech, the worth of <a href="https://space.nss.org/wp-content/uploads/Near-Earth-Asteroid-Mining-Ross-2001.pdf" target="_blank">raw materials extracted from a single small asteroid could be worth millions of dollars</a> even without factoring the countless jobs this industry would create. This number would only grow with the development of new, more efficient processes. This incentive will likely cause mining companies to shift their focus to the study of astronomy and commit their vast resources into the subjugation of the stars. In this way, the commercialization of extraterrestrial mining appears in tandem with the mastery of astronomy, which will one day allow us to colonize the stars and find humanity’s new home.</p>

					<h2 class="major">Harnessing Stars as a Galactic Mining Mechanism</h2>
							<ul>
					<li>Traditional physical digging and mining won’t work on everything</li>
					
					<li>We can directly and indirectly use the energy stars emit to mine
</li>
					</ul>			
<p>While the study of astral mining processes is still under development, two main branches of thought are dominating the discussion. The first is a traditional approach with physical digging and mining to extract resources from celestial bodies. However, this would not work on smaller objects like asteroids, as they are <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2010/01/earth-can-shake-asteroids-too" target="_blank">delicately held together by their own gravity.</a> The other school of thought is to directly or indirectly <a href="https://www.space.com/moon-asteroid-space-mining-with-concentrated-sunlight.html" target="_blank">use a star’s energy to harvest materials.</a> The process involving the direct use of a star would be through heliostats, or mirrors that track a star’s position, to direct an energy into a target to fracture it and expose valuable materials. It is also possible to indirectly put a star to use by powering drones with solar energy to inject high energy radiation to melt the resources and collect the liquid for later processing.
